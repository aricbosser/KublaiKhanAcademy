Verify Clone Success
Try editing the readme file with a note and clone the changes
Hereâ€™s the correct sequence to verify your local git clone and push the change you made to the README file:

1. Pull the Latest Changes
  First, make sure your local repository is up to date with the remote repository:
  
  git pull origin <branch-name>
  
  Replace <branch-name> with the branch you're working on (likely main, dev, or qa).
  Example for the dev branch:
  
  git pull origin dev

2. Stage the Changes
  Add the modified README.md file to the staging area:
  
  git add README.md

3. Commit the Changes
  Create a commit with a meaningful message:

  git commit -m "Updated README file with small change"

4. Push the Changes
Now push the changes to the remote branch:

git push origin <branch-name>
Example for the dev branch:

git push origin dev

This will upload your changes to the remote GitHub repository.
You can verify the update by visiting the repository on GitHub.
